- Smooth task reordering with `v-auto-animate`
- Planned improvements: Add a "Delete All" tasks function and improve accessibility.

## Getting Started

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chayboats/typescript-vue-todo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd typescript-vue-todo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Vue.js
- v-auto-animate
- HTML5 & CSS3

## What I Learned

This project was my first experience with TypeScript, helping me improve my understanding of type definitions and stricter typing within a Vue.js project. I also gained experience with UI transitions using `v-auto-animate` and managing state in a task management system. 

## Continued Development

In future updates, I plan to:
- Add a "Delete All" tasks option.
- Improve accessibility to meet Web Accessibility standards.
- Ensure tasks are navigable via keyboard (e.g., tab keys) and adjust color contrast to better distinguish task priorities.
